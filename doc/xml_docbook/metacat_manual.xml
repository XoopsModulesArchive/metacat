  <abstract>
    <para>MetaCat, the Xoops Meta Category Manager, can manage
    &#34;categories&#34; (aka &#34;topics&#34;) across different modules and
    helps to cross-link related content in a Xoops 2.0 website.</para>
  </abstract>

  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>MetaCat brings together category management from a number of
    different modules. Categories can be created, edited, added or removed
    from individual modules, and moved to a differen place within the
    hierarchy.</para>

    <para>Development of Metacat was funded by <ulink url="http://sev.nl">Stuurgroep

  <sect1>
    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>Installing MetaCat comes in one not-so-easy and three easy steps:</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Upload</title>

      <para>Upload the <filename>/metacat</filename> directory from the
      distribution into your Xoops 2.0 <filename>/modules</filename>
      directory.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Module Configuration</title>

      <para>Before you can install MetaCat, you need to tell it which
      modules&#39; categories it should manage and how these modules handle
      categories internally. This is done by editing the <filename>/modules/metacat/class/modules.dat.php</filename>
      file in a text editor. Here&#39;s a sample from that file, showing the
      module data for the &#34;mydownloads&#34; module:</para>

      <programlisting>$modules[&#39;mydownloads&#39;] = array( 
    // name of the module-directory
    &#39;name&#39; =&#62; &#39;mydownloads&#39;, 
    // name of the GET variable to select a category
    &#39;cat_get_var&#39; =&#62; &#39;cid&#39;, 
    // url (relative to site root) to display a category
    &#39;cat_view_url&#39; =&#62; &#39;/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=%s&#39;, 
    // descriptive name of the type of items the module has
    &#39;item_type&#39; =&#62; &#39;Downloads&#39;, 
    // database table where the module stores its category information
    &#39;cat_table&#39; =&#62; &#39;mydownloads_cat&#39;, 
    // column in cat_table that holds the category title
    &#39;title_field&#39; =&#62; &#39;title&#39;, 
    // column in cat_table that holds the category ID
    &#39;cat_id_field&#39; =&#62; &#39;cid&#39;, 
    // column in cat_table that holds the parent&#39;s ID
    // (leave empty if module has no sub-categories.)
    &#39;parent_id_field&#39; =&#62; &#39;pid&#39;, 
    // column in cat_table that holds the information about the category image/icon
    // (leave empty if module has no category images.)
    &#39;image_reference_field&#39; =&#62; &#39;imgurl&#39;, 
    // type of the image information used.
    // &#34;URL&#34; - image can be anywhere, fully qualified URL given
    // &#34;PATH&#34; - image is in module-specific directory &#34;image_upload_path&#34;. Give filename only.
    &#39;image_reference_type&#39; =&#62; &#39;URL&#39;, 
    // if &#34;image_reference_type&#34; is &#34;PATH&#34;, this is the absolute path to copy images to
    &#39;image_upload_path&#39; =&#62; &#39;&#39;, 
    // table in the database that holds content for this module
    &#39;content_table&#39; =&#62; &#39;mydownloads_downloads&#39;, 
    // column in content_table that holds the category ID
    &#39;content_cat_field&#39; =&#62; &#39;cid&#39;, 
    // column in content_table that holds the content ID
    &#39;content_id_field&#39; =&#62; &#39;lid&#39;, 
    // name of the GET var to select one content item.
    &#39;content_get_var&#39; =&#62; &#39;lid&#39;, 
);</programlisting>

      <para>This is a lot of information, but it is all needed for MetaCat to
      function correctly. Data for the Xoops 2.0 default modules is already
      provided. you only need to edit this if you&#39;ve changed e.g. the
      directory a module is installed in.</para>

      <para>If you don&#39;t have one of these modules installed or don&#39;t
      want MetaCat to manage its categories, simply comment out that modules
      definition by enclosing it in comment delimiters like this:</para>

      <programlisting>/*
...
*/</programlisting>

      <para>The modules.dat.php file makes it quite easy to add support for
      addon Xoops 2.0 modules. Simply copy the block of an existing module and
      change it to match your module&#39;s specifications. You may have to do
      some research in the module&#39;s database table definitions to do that,
      or try to get help from the module&#39;s author. Hopefully module
      authors will start to include MetaCat definition data in their
      distributions.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Installation</title>

      <para>Now you are ready to install MetaCat using the Xoops 2.0 Module
      Manager Console, just like you would any other module.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Initialization</title>

      <para>To start managing your categories with MetaCat, you will first
      want to import your current categories from the modules into MetaCat. To
      do this, select &#34;<guimenuitem>Initialize Categories</guimenuitem>&#34;
      from the MetaCat popup menu and click &#34;<guibutton>Submit</guibutton>&#34;
      in reply to the security prompt.</para>

      <para>MetaCat will first erase its own category database, then scan
      through all installed modules and import the categories. Top-level
      categories with identical names in different modules will be treated as
      one category that is active in all those modules. Sub-categories will
      only be treated as one module if they have the same name and are
      children of parents that are treated as one category.</para>

      <para>It is not possible to import category images from the modules. The
      categories will keep their current images until you change it from
      MetaCat. Until you do that, the category will be shown as &#34;no
      image&#34; in MetaCat, even though there may be images active in
      individual modules. (Take this to mean &#34;no centrally managed
      image&#34;.)</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Due to the process used in initialization, all categories
        already in MetaCat, but not activated in any module will be deleted.</para>
      </warning>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Managing Categories</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Create Category</title>

      <para>In MetaCat&#39;s Category Manager, you will find a form to create
      a new category. Simply enter a title and a description, submit the form,
      and a new top-level category will be created.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Activate/Deactivate Category</title>

      <para>At the top of the Category Manager, you see a map of all existing
      categories and installed modules. Here you can activate a category for
      use in a module or deactivate it.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Activate</title>

        <para>To activate a category in a module, simply click on the
        <inlinegraphic fileref="images/add.gif" format="GIF" /> icon right of
        the category name and under the module name. If there is no icon
        shown, this means the category can&#39;t be activated in that module,
        most likely because it is a sub-category and the module supports only
        one level of categories.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Deactivate</title>

        <para>To deactivate a category in a module, click on the corresponding
        <inlinegraphic fileref="images/trash.png" /> icon. If the Icon is
        marked with an <inlinegraphic fileref="images/trash-x.png" />, this
        means the category can&#39;t be deactivated, most likely because it
        has active sub-categories or because it has content in that module. To
        remove a category like that, first remove or move all content and
        deactivate all sub-categories.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Edit Category</title>

      <para>If you click on the &#34;edit&#34; link for a category, you can
      change a number of details for that category:</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>General Info</title>

        <para>This allows you to change the title and description of the
        category. Just enter the new information and submit.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Parent</title>

        <para>You can move a category to a different place in the hierarchy.
        Just select the new parent category in the drop-down list and submit.
        MetaCat will check if the new parent is &#34;valid&#34; and make the
        change.</para>

        <para>A category can&#39;t be moved to a new parent if</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the new parent is a child of itself, or</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>the category is active in a module that doesn&#39;t support
            sub-categories.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Category Image</title>

        <para>Here you can upload an image to be used for the category in
        modules that support this. Note that no &#34;list of existing
        images&#34; is there to choose from, because images are copied to
        module-specific directories after upload. Simply upload the image
        again if you want to reuse one.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Delete Category</title>

      <para>If a category is not active in any module and also has no
      sub-categories, you can remove it from MetaCat by clicking the
      corresponding &#34;delete&#34; link. The link is not visible if the
      conditions for removal are not met.</para>

      <title>PREAMBLE</title>

      <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other functional and useful document &#34;free&#34; in the sense of
      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or
      noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
      publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
      responsible for modifications made by others.</para>

      <para>This License is a kind of &#34;copyleft&#34;, which means that
      derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
      sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
      copyleft license designed for free software.</para>

      <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
      program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
      software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
      can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
      whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
      principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

      <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

      <para id="gfdl-doc">This License applies to any manual or other work, in
      any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
      it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice
      grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
      that work under the conditions stated herein. The &#34;Document&#34;,
      below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
      licensee, and is addressed as &#34;you&#34;. You accept the license if
      you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
      under copyright law.</para>

      <para id="gfdl-mod-ver">A &#34;Modified Version&#34; of the Document
      means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
      verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</para>

      <para id="gfdl-secnd-sect">A &#34;Secondary Section&#34; is a named
      appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals
      exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the
      Document to the Document&#39;s overall subject (or to related matters)
      and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
      subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
      Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship
      could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with
      related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or
      political position regarding them.</para>

      <para id="gfdl-inv-sect">The &#34;Invariant Sections&#34; are certain
      Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
      Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is
      released under this License. If a section does not fit the above
      definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
      Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the
      Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</para>

      <para id="gfdl-cov-text">The &#34;Cover Texts&#34; are certain short
      passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover
      Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
      License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover
      Text may be at most 25 words.</para>

      <para id="gfdl-transparent">A &#34;Transparent&#34; copy of the Document
      means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose
      specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for
      revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or
      (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)
      some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
      text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
      suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
      Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been
      arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is
      not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
      substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &#34;Transparent&#34; is
      called &#34;Opaque&#34;.</para>

      <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
      ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
      XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.</para>

      <para id="gfdl-title-page">The &#34;Title Page&#34; means, for a printed
      book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
      hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title
      page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
      &#34;Title Page&#34; means the text near the most prominent appearance
      of the work&#39;s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
      text.</para>

      <para id="gfdl-entitled">A section &#34;Entitled XYZ&#34; means a named
      subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains
      XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
      language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below,
      such as &#34;Acknowledgements&#34;, &#34;Dedications&#34;,
      &#34;Endorsements&#34;, or &#34;History&#34;.) To &#34;Preserve the
      Title&#34; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it
      remains a section &#34;Entitled XYZ&#34; according to this definition.</para>

      <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
      which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the

      <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

      <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
      the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
      technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
      of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
      compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
      number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

      <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
      and you may publicly display copies.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="gfdl-3">
      <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

      <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
      have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
      copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
      Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
      cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
      to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
      satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.</para>

      <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
      pages.</para>

      <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
      numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
      Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
      Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
      network-using public has access to download using public-standard
      network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
      added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
      prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
      to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
      stated location until at least one year after the last time you
      distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
      of that edition to the public.</para>

      <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
      the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
      give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the

      <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other

      Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
      permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
      translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
      original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
      translation of this License, and all the license notices in the

    </section>
  </appendix>

  <appendix>
    <title>GNU General Public License</title>

    <sect1>
      <title>Preamble</title>

      <para>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
      freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
      License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
      software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
      General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
      Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit
      to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
      the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
      your programs, too.</para>

      <para>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
      have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
      this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
      you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
      free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</para>

      <para>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
      These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
      distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</para>

      <para>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
      you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
      source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
      rights.</para>

      <para>We protect your rights with two steps: <orderedlist><listitem><para>copyright
      the software, and</para></listitem><listitem><para>offer you this
      license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
      modify the software.</para></listitem></orderedlist></para>

      <para>Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
      free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed
      on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
      original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
      the original authors&#39; reputations.</para>

      <para>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
      patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
      program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
      program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
      patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at
      all.</para>

      <para>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
      modification follow.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</title>

      <sect2>
        <title>Section 0</title>

        <para>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
        a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
        under the terms of this General Public License. The &#34;Program&#34;,
        below, refers to any such program or work, and a <quote>work based on
        the Program </quote> means either the Program or any derivative work
        under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or
        a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
        translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
        included without limitation in the term <quote>modification </quote>.)
        Each licensee is addressed as <quote>you</quote>.</para>

        <para>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
        not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
        running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
        is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
        (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
        is true depends on what the Program does.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="sect1">
        <title>Section 1</title>

        <para>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
        notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
        and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
        along with the Program.</para>

        <para>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
        copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
        for a fee.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="sect2">
        <title>Section 2</title>

        <para>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of <link
        linkend="sect1">Section 1 </link> above, provided that you also meet
        all of these conditions: <orderedlist><listitem><para>You must cause
        the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
        the files and the date of any change.</para></listitem><listitem><para>You
        must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
        in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
        to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
        terms of this License.</para></listitem><listitem><para>If the
        modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
        must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
        (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
        redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
        how to view a copy of this License. <note><title>Exception:</title><para>If
        the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
        announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
        an announcement.)</para></note></para></listitem></orderedlist></para>

        <para>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
        identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
        and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
        themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
        sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
        on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
        this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
        entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
        it.</para>

        <para>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
        contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
        intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
        derivative or collective works based on the Program.</para>

        <para>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
        Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
        volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
        work under the scope of this License.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Section 3</title>

        <para>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
        under <link linkend="sect2">Section 2 </link> in object code or
        executable form under the terms of <link linkend="sect1">Sections 1
        </link> and <link linkend="sect2">2 </link> above provided that you
        also do one of the following: <orderedlist><listitem><para>Accompany
        it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
        must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
        medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</para></listitem><listitem><para>Accompany
        it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any
        third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
        performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of
        the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
        interchange; or,</para></listitem><listitem><para>Accompany it with
        the information you received as to the offer to distribute
        corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
        noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
        object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
        Subsection b above.)</para></listitem></orderedlist></para>

        <para>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
        source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
        plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used
        to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as
        a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
        anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
        form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
        operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
        itself accompanies the executable.</para>

        <para>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
        access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
        access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
        distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</para>

        <title>Section 4</title>

        <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
        except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
        to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
        will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
        parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
        License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
        parties remain in full compliance.</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Section 5</title>

        <para>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
        signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
        distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
        prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
        modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
        all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
        the Program or works based on it.</para>

        <title>Section 6</title>

        <para>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
        these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
        restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted
        herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
        parties to this License.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Section 7</title>

        <para>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
        distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
        may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
        license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
        the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</para>

        <para>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
        under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
        intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
        other circumstances.</para>

        <para>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
        any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
        any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
        integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
        implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
        impose that choice.</para>

        <para>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
        believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Section 8</title>

        <para>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
        original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
        may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
        those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
        countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
        the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Section 9</title>

        <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</para>

        <para>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it
        and &#34;any later version&#34;, you have the option of following the
        terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
        specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
        ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Section 10</title>

        <para>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
        software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</para>

        <title>NO WARRANTY Section 11</title>

        <para>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
        EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
        OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &#34;AS IS&#34; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
        ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
        THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
        PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
        THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</para>

        <title>Section 12</title>

        <para>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
        WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
        AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
        FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
        PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
        RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
        FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
        SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.</para>

      <title>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</title>

      <para>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
      greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to
      make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under
      these terms.</para>

      <para>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
      safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
      effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
      at least the &#34;copyright&#34; line and a pointer to where the full
      notice is found.</para>

      <para>&#60;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of
      what it does.&#62; Copyright (C) &#60;year&#62; &#60;name of author&#62;</para>

      <para>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published
      by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at
      your option) any later version.</para>

      <para>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General
      Public License for more details.</para>

      <para>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
      Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</para>

      <para>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
      mail.</para>

      <para>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
      this when it starts in an interactive mode:</para>

      <para>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show
      w&#39;. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.</para>

      <para>The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should
      show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
      commands you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and
      `show c&#39;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
      suits your program.</para>

      <para>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
      your school, if any, to sign a &#34;copyright disclaimer&#34; for the
      program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</para>

      <para>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      program `Gnomovision&#39; (which makes passes at compilers) written by
      James Hacker.</para>

      <para>&#60;signature of Ty Coon&#62;, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of
      Vice</para>

      <para>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
      program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
      library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
      applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
      GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.</para>
